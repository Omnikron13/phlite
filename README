::: OVERVIEW :::
Phlite is a PHP library that provides functionality for user authentication,
user & group management, user & group permissions, CSRF protection, etc. with an
SQLite database backend. It is designed to be lightweight & minimal, while
maintaining a high level of security and configurability.

You can find the latest release of Phlite at the project homepage:
https://github.com/Omnikron13/phlite

Alternatively you can anonymously clone the latest revision with git:
git clone https://github.com/Omnikron13/phlite.git

::: REQUIREMENTS :::
Phlite requires PHP version 7.1 or higher.
The pdo_sqlite extension is also required, which may require installation of a
separate package, as well as enabling in your php.ini file.
SQLite version 3.6.19 or higher is required for enforcement of foreign key
contraints.

::: INSTALLATION :::
To install simply copy the phlite directory into your PHP include path.
An instance can then be easily initialised:

    require 'phlite/Phlite.php';
    Phlite\Config::load('your_config.cfg');
    Phlite\setupDB();
